# NB_IoT_SDR_BaseStation_Project
Explore NB-IoT signal processing with MATLAB in this project. Learn about signal generation, upsampling, low-pass filtering, and analyzing signals in the frequency domain. Ideal for understanding NB-IoT base station operations and software-defined radio techniques.

## Overview
Welcome to the NB-IoT Base Station Signal Processing with SDR repository. This MATLAB project delves into the intricacies of signal processing for Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) base stations, leveraging software-defined radio (SDR) techniques. It offers a thorough exploration of various signal processing steps, including signal generation, upsampling, low-pass filtering, and frequency domain analysis.

## Project Description
The project is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of how NB-IoT signals are processed in a base station context. Key areas covered include:
- **Signal Generation**: Crafting NB-IoT signals using MATLAB functions.
- **Upsampling**: Increasing the sampling rate of generated signals to meet specific requirements.
- **Low-Pass Filtering**: Applying filters to upsampled signals to remove unwanted high-frequency components.
- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Visualizing and analyzing the signals in the frequency domain to understand their characteristics.
